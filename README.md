# GitHub Copilot test

All boilerplate was created with GitHub Copilot and simple queries:

> Create a basic pyproject.toml file for a package called "copilot-test"

Blanks were filled in and the Documentation link was replaced.

> Add a file LICENSE containing the MIT license

Copied as is.

> Write a .gitignore file for a Python project

Copied as is.
